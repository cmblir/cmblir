Hi, As a Python data engineer with a passion for development  
I've honed my skills in extracting insights from data and building robust data pipelines.  
Now, I'm venturing into Java backend development, driven by my insatiable curiosity for crafting efficient and scalable solutions.  
I thrive on challenges and am eager to immerse myself in the world of backend development, where I can leverage my problem-solving abilities and penchant for innovation to create impactful software solutions. üêç

## Languages I've Worked In

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp,java,python,bash,powershell)](https://skillicons.dev)

primarily use C++ for solving algorithmic problems.  
While I typically use PowerShell in the terminal, _I personally prefer Bash or zsh._

## Library | Framework
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=tensorflow,selenium,flask,spring)](https://skillicons.dev)

For web development, I work with Java and Spring, using IntelliJ as my development tool.  
For data analysis with AI, I prefer Python, leveraging TensorFlow for machine learning, and Selenium for data collection.  
When I need to visualize data or create lightweight sites, I turn to Flask.

## Database

choose databases based on the task at hand.  
At my current company, I use Apache Hive with Trino and Zeppelin. However, for personal projects, I prefer lighter options like SQLite or PostgreSQL.  
MySQL was the first database I learned when I started studying queries.

## Software I Use Often
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=visualstudio,idea,vim,windows,linux)](https://skillicons.dev)

For development, I use VS Code for Python and IntelliJ for Java. When I need to make quick edits, I occasionally use Vim directly in the terminal.  
primarily work in a Mac environment, but I find Linux to be more suitable for handling databases since it's similar to Mac.  
also use Windows to align with the development environments typically found in Korea.

## Collaboration / Marketing tool

For team collaboration, I mainly used Jira and Slack.  
To track user reactions and for marketing purposes, I worked with Braze for app push notifications.
